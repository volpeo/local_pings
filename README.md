#Local Pings

Lightweight script to ping local hosts and see result on responsive page.

##Goal
* This simple script was designed to have a sexy view of hosts status.
* This is for LAN hosts, more than public hosts.
* If you want a public hosts ping, check pingdom.com

##Features
* Display status (Online ; Slow ; Down)
* Display latency in ms

##Installation
* Edit conf-example.php and replace Names and IP by yours
* Add any more lines that you want
* Rename conf-example.php to conf.php

##Todo
* Correct bug that do not show last host delay


##Disclaimer
This is my first share on GitHub. I'm noob on php, english and coding in general, please be tolerant.
Any help or optimisation are welcome.
